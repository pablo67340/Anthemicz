## Melle's Background:

I grew up in a small town in Canada called Barrie with my amazing parents, Peter and Angelik, and my little brother Nauz. Barrie is a super musical place and I was hired by the city to street perform all throughout high school. I have struggled with my mental health since I was 10, but after meeting Jaxon when I was 15, he helped me realize I have a purpose in life. My purpose is to heal people through music. I now have an album produced by Grammy Award Winning Producer Kizzo, and over 2 million + followers and subscribers across all platforms.

## Goals & Aspirations within the Anthemicz and GenZ Movement:

My goals and aspirations within the Anthemicz and GenZ Movement is to help our generation have better relationships and improved mental health through our music. All of my friends growing up and today have struggled with their mental health, and I want to eliminate as much suffering as we can while also providing our generation with hope for a brighter future.

## Pushing towards these goals:

I am doing a lot of things to push towards these goals. One thing in particular, is connecting with my fans on my YouTube series called “SPLIT/SHEET TV: Songwriting With Everyone”. I ask my followers to tell their stories. We then take these stories and turn them into songs, which means the followers make the split sheet and create with us together forever. It’s a really great way to feel connected with my fans, while also showing them that it does get better.
